# verbose: Print info or not (set to false for large runs)
# grid_dx_in_m: grid step in meters. 
# At the equator, 1 degree of latitude is approx. 110.5 km
# grid_lat_min: minimum lat in degrees (-90 - 90) 
# grid_lat_max: maximum lat in degrees (-90 - 90)
# grid_lon_min: minimum lon in degrees (-180 - 180)
# grid_lon_max: maximum lon in degrees (-180 - 180)
# only_ocean_sources: if set to true, then source locations on land will be
# discarded upfront
# synt_data: specify if your synthetics shall be displacement
#                (DIS), velocity (VEL) or acceleration (ACC)
# wavefield_type: set here the type of wavefield you want to use: 
# -- analytic (analytic Green's function for homogeneous membrane wave)
# -- instaseis (use instaseis; need to specify the path to the instaseis
#    database as wavefield_path)
# -- custom (you need to prepare your own wave field if this is set, and
#    specify the path to the files as wavefield_path)
# wavefield_point_force: Force in N applied by each noise source. Note that if 
# setting this very low, the amplitude of the correlations will become very 
# small, and problems with numerical precision can arise.
# wavefield_path: set here the path to instaseis database or your wavefield
# database from another solver (not needed for analytic Green's functions)
# wavefield_sampling_rate: Sampling rate for the instaseis or analytic 
# wavefield_domain: Save in "fourier" or "time" domain 
# waveforms green's functions in Hz.
# wavefield_duration: Duration of prepared green's functions in seconds.
# wavefield_filter: [freq_min, freq_max] of prepared green's functions in Hz.
# wavefield_channel: Synthetics channel (of recording), Z, E, N or "all". This
# also determines which correlation channels (ZZ, ZE, ZN...NN...) are computed.
