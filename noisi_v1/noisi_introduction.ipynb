    "<img src=\"correlation_TAM_ISP.png\"  width=\"1200\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Correlation\" title=\"\" align=center />\n",
    "\n",
    "This brief tutorial is intended to go step by step through the computation of ambient noise cross-correlations with a spatially variable distribution of noise sources. Computations are done in Python, on the basis of a database of Green's functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Ambient noise cross-correlations are an important seismologic observable, since they can be used to infer properties of the Earth's crust (e.g. Shapiro et al., 2005) and the ambient seismic wave field. Increasingly, cross-correlations are regarded as an observable in their own right, without equating them to empirical Green's functions. For this approach, forward modeling of cross-correlations plays an important role. Tromp et al. (2010), Hanasoge (2013) and other authors have suggested how cross-correlations can be computed without simulating the random noise field itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these authors, ambient noise cross-correlations are computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "C_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\boldsymbol{x}_2,\\tau) = \\int\\limits_{\\partial\\oplus} \\left[\\,G_{jm}(\\boldsymbol{x}_2,\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t) \\ast  G_{in}(\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\boldsymbol{\\xi},-t) \\ast S_{nm}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t) \\, \\right] (\\tau)\\, d\\boldsymbol{\\xi}, \n",
    "\\label{eq:corr_single}\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the Green's functions $G_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$ represent wave propagation from the noise source component $ j $ at $ \\xi$ to the receiver component $i $ at $x$, $ S_{nm}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)  $ is the auto-correlation of the ambient seismic source components $n, m$ at source location $ \\xi $, and the integral is over the Earth's surface Further details can be found, for example, in Tromp et al. (2010), Hanasoge (2013), Fichtner (2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using pre-computed wave fields\n",
    "For simulation of noise cross-correlations (forward modeling) or pure noise source inversion (without tomographic inversion), only the parameter $S_{nm}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$ needs to be optimized. Hence, the Green's functions $G_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$, which usually represent the computationally most challenging part of the model, can be computed at the beginning and then recycled. This can save considerable computational effort, in particular when already existing Green's function databases such as the ones hosted on [Syngine](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/syngine/) (Krischer et al., 2017) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application for such an approach include ambient noise source inversion in regions where the structure is reasonably well known, or forward modelling of power spectral densities of the noise. Examples include Ermert et al. (2017) and Datta et al. (2019).\n",
