Noisi - ambient noise cross-correlation modeling and inversion

This tool can be used to simulate noise cross-correlations and sensitivity kernels to noise sources.

Running this tool requires:
obspy
basemap
pandas
mpi4py

If installing in a conda environment with pip, pip will try to meet most requirements automatically, however, basemap has to be installed manually using conda. mpi4py also has to be installed manually (an mpi compiler is required), and in order to install mpi4py, it is recommended to use pip (pip install mpi4py).

When the requirements are met, the tool can be set up by cloning, changing into the top noisi/ directory and calling pip install -v .

After installation, consider running pytest in the noisi_v1/noisi directory. 

To see an overview of the tool, type noisi_v1 --help.
